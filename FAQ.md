# Call of Duty - Gun Game | FAQ
Q: Can I use any weapon/playermodel (addon) I want?<br />
A: Yes, you can use any weapon or playermodel you want as long as the server has installed the required addons and you're using a dedicated server. Please keep the secondary weapon a melee-type weapon.

Q: Do I need to install the additional addons?
A: No, you are not required to install any of the additional addons. I used these addons during the development of the gamemode to make the gamemode feel more Call of Duty-like. The gamemode will function in the same way as it would with the additional addons being installed.

Q: Can I use this gamemode if I don't have a dedicated server?<br />
A: Yes, you can use this gamemode in a 'singleplayer' server but remember that it's not really made for this kind of server.

Q: I can't press the 'Start Game' button!<br />
A: Only admins and players defined in the `GG_ALLOWED_PLAYERS` table are allowed to start the match. If you can't edit the `settings.lua` file, please install a rank/permissions manager.

Q: I don't see a countdown screen after starting the match!<br/ >
A: When this happens it's likely that your addon version doesn't match the server one. Please make sure that both are up-to-date. It's not really a huge problem if the screen doesn't appear as the gamemode still runs in the background.

Q: The MySQL database doesn't work!<br />
A: Make sure that you configured the database settings correctly. Also make sure that you've installed the required modules.
